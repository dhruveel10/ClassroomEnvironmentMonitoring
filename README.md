School administrators can realize real-time collection and monitoring of classroom environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity and smoke concentration through this system, which is convenient for school administrators to view the actual situation of the classroom environment, and realize parameter control by controlling curtain, light, fan and other equipment to ensure that the classroom is in a more comfortable environment
